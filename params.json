{"name":"WHPIC","tagline":"A simple interpreted calculator written in Python","body":"WHPIC\r\n=====\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe WHPIC (Will Hodges Python Interpreted Calculator) is a proof of concept interpreter (sort of) written in Python.\r\nIt is written using the [Grako](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/grako/3.6.5) library for Python, which generates the parser.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe WHPIC uses an Expanded Backus-Naur Form grammar to define the rules of the calculator. Currently, the WHPIC is just a standard addition/subtraction/multiplication/division calculator that supports two number statements, ending with a semicolon.\r\n\r\nThe grammar is converted into a parser with Grako (see above). It generates `calc.py`, which has all the parser mumbo-jumbo.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the content that is parsed occurs in `imp.py`. `imp.py` imports the parser and uses its functions to get a JSON-like result that is then parsed into numbers and operators, then calculated and returned.\r\n\r\n`imp.py` is well-commented, so it should be basically self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nCan I use it?\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nSure! Just clone the repo, and read the Readme!\r\n\r\nCan I contribute?\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nYes, just clone the repo and improve it however you see necessary. Then, you can submit a pull request and have it merged with the main repo!\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
